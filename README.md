   [12:07 A.M. November 7 2017]: Website working but the only problem left to sort out is the dashboard and some "major routing issues"

   [01:05 November 7 2017] Completed it !!!!! Its done and ready to rock the web with some minor changes and template designs and in some                             time the dashboard would be through angular which wouldmake the whole thing dynamic.One more thing is that i                               am not able to direct my login to my dashboard directly it has to go though this homepage so thats anothe                                 minor bug. Everything major is fixed and ready to rock.

   [02:50 November 8 2017] Done with some major fixes a very minor tweak of work is left!

   [08:23 November 26 2017] Done with the basic functionality of the website the content is quite fine.The maps API is kind of buggy.
                            It needs time and i will be fixing it once i am done with my semester end examination.Enjoyed the process of                               web development and felt great after this project.Once i am done with the admin panel this will be published                               either on AWS or Azure as per convinence.
